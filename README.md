The 'Introduction to Cloud Computing' workshop was created for the [Powercoders](https://powercoders.org/) project with the intention to teach the participants how to deploy a website in the Cloud using an Apache HTTP Server (httpd) running on RedHat OpenShift. In addition, the exercises introduce the basic concepts of Cloud Computing.
